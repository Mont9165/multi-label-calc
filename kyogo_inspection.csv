- Improved variable naming for clarity (beamport/beamstarboard prefixes)

different extents are closer on port vs starboard sides (5-sided polygons).

- Coordinate mapping from 3D geometry to beam arrays

## Static SVG Rendering System
- SVG export with geometric structure visualization
- Beam polygons with positioning and OKLCH color support
- Facet edge line rendering for structure clarity
- Extended mode showing beam IDs and relationships
- Responsive viewport sizing and presentation
- Validation framework with automated test generation

## Patterns Module
- Pattern development framework with base classes

- Pattern discovery system with automatic file scanning
- OKLCH color space integration for color control
- Schema definitions for beam array column access
- Mathematical pattern implementations (ripple, spiral, wave, breathe)

## Web Preview and Animation System
- FastAPI server with WebSocket streaming for real-time animation
- Frame generation at 30+ FPS with vectorized numpy operations
- Concurrent client broadcasting with timeout protection
- HTML5 client with pattern selector and live visualization
- Client-side frame handling with immediate rendering
- Real-time pattern switching and example collection

## Configuration and Validation
- JSON configuration system for geometric parameters
- Validation suite with visual output generation

7090d0d70913ad8dd66840daa9f13832d5a87e0d,"Implement Delphi integration for CrossCoder interpretability (Issue #703)

This commit adds comprehensive integration with the Delphi interpretability library,
enabling advanced feature analysis for CrossCoder models.

Key features:
- CrossCoder adapters for Delphi compatibility (single and dual model)
- Modified latent cache supporting dual model activation collection
- Anthropic Batch API integration for 10-100x faster processing
- Token alignment and chat template handling for different architectures
- HTML visualizations with feature explanations and scores
- Configuration-driven pipeline with YAML inheritance

Components:
- src/crosscoder/delphi_integration/: Core integration modules
  - crosscoder_adapter.py: Adapters for Delphi's sparse coder interface
  - crosscoder_cache.py: Extended cache for dual model activations
  - batch_explainer.py: Batch API for efficient explanation generation
  - tokenization_bridge.py: Handles chat templates and alignment
- experiments/delphi_analysis/: Analysis pipeline and testing
- configs/delphi_analysis/: YAML configurations
- delphi/: Complete Delphi library included as subfolder

The integration processes millions of tokens efficiently, generates human-readable
explanations for features, and scores their quality using multiple metrics.

This commit replaces .netrc with uv environment variables for installing

`$HOME/.config/crewai/settings.json`.

The issue with .netrc files is that they are applied system-wide and are
scoped by hostname, meaning we can't differentiate tool repositories
requests from regular requests to CrewAI's API.

* Added is_auto_end flag in agentops.end session in crew.py (#1320)

When using agentops, we have the option to pass the `skip_auto_end_session` parameter, which is supposed to not end the session if the `end_session` function is called by Crew.

Now the way it works is, the `agentops.end_session` accepts `is_auto_end` flag and crewai should have passed it as `True` (its `False` by default). 

I have changed the code to pass is_auto_end=True

9431a4e2acb0458b26d4b5fe1f7f947a6d3ea813,"refactor: Modularize large files into focused subdirectories

Address code review feedback by breaking down large modules into smaller,
focused components for improved maintainability.

## Refactoring Changes

### PRISMA Package (knowledge_storm/prisma/)
- **models.py**: Core data structures (Paper, SearchStrategy, etc.)
- **search.py**: SearchStrategyBuilder for PICO methodology
- **screening.py**: ScreeningAssistant + PRISMAScreener (80/20 rule)
- **extraction.py**: DataExtractionHelper for systematic data extraction
- **reporting.py**: ZeroDraftGenerator for overcoming blank page syndrome
- **assistant.py**: Main PRISMAAssistant orchestrator
- **__init__.py**: Clean exports for external use

### VERIFY Package (knowledge_storm/verify/)
- **models.py**: Core data structures (Claim, VerificationResult, etc.)
- **fact_checker.py**: FactChecker for claim verification
- **memory.py**: ResearchMemory for learning patterns
- **fixer.py**: TargetedFixer for surgical corrections
- **system.py**: Main VERIFYSystem orchestrator
- **__init__.py**: Clean exports for external use

## Task Management Cleanup

- Simplified verbose `details` fields in tasks.json (725 → more readable)
- Moved implementation logs to `.taskmaster/logs/` for better organization
- Preserved essential task definitions while improving JSON readability
- Created backup of original tasks.json

## Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused modules easier to understand/modify
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Reusability**: Individual components can be imported as needed
- **Organization**: Clear separation of concerns across subdirectories
- **Documentation**: Each module has a specific, clear purpose

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing imports continue to work through __init__.py exports
- Updated test_verify_system.py to use new modular imports
- Original large files backed up as .bak files
- No breaking changes to external APIs

b900ffc4490971f1b434b43e7f664284a267e4d7,"feat: Add beautiful rich-based logging system for orchestrator

## Overview
Replaced the previous ugly JSON log output with a comprehensive, structured logging system using the rich library for beautiful terminal output. This dramatically improves the developer experience when monitoring agent orchestration.

## Key Features Added

### 1. Rich-Based Logging Utilities (defog/llm/utils_logging.py)
- **OrchestrationLogger class**: Centralized logging with beautiful formatting
- **Rich console integration**: Colors, panels, tables, and trees for structured output
- **Global logger instance**: `orch_logger` available throughout the codebase

### 2. Comprehensive Logging Methods
- `log_request_start()`: Beautiful header with user request in styled panel
- `log_planning_analysis()`: Formatted analysis with automatic list detection and tree rendering
- `log_llm_call()`: Clean LLM provider/model logging with consistent styling
- `log_subagent_plans()`: Rich table showing agent configuration + individual task panels
- `log_task_execution_start()`: Task start with parallel/sequential mode indicators
- `log_task_execution_complete()`: Success/failure with result previews and metadata (tokens/cost)
- `log_retry_attempt()`: Retry progress with attempt counters and wait times
- `log_error_detail()`: Categorized error display with color-coded error types
- `log_orchestration_complete()`: Summary statistics table with totals

### 3. Orchestrator Integration (defog/llm/orchestrator.py)
- **Strategic logging placement**: Key orchestration events are logged with context
- **Request lifecycle tracking**: From initial request → planning → execution → completion
- **Error handling improvements**: Better error classification and logging
- **Null safety**: Fixed cost calculation errors when cost_in_cents is None

### 4. Visual Improvements
- **Color-coded status**: Green (success), red (error), yellow (warning), cyan (info)
- **Structured tables**: Agent configurations, statistics, and summaries
- **Rich panels**: Important information highlighted in bordered panels
- **Progress indicators**: Clear task execution flow with emojis and status
- **Error categorization**: Network, rate limit, auth, model, validation, server errors

### 5. Developer Experience Enhancements
- **Readable output**: No more raw JSON dumps cluttering the terminal
- **Context preservation**: Entity names, task IDs, and agent relationships are clear
- **Real-time monitoring**: Easy to follow agent orchestration progress
- **Debugging support**: Rich tracebacks and detailed error information

## Technical Details
- **Dependencies**: Added rich library for terminal rendering
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing logging.getLogger() calls still work
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead, rich output only when needed
- **Configurability**: Easy to adjust log levels and output formatting

## Before/After
**Before**: Raw JSON dumps with ugly, unstructured output
**After**: Beautiful, color-coded, hierarchical logging with tables, panels, and trees

This logging system transforms the developer experience from frustrating JSON parsing to intuitive, visual monitoring of complex agent orchestration workflows.
