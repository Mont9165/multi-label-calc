This commit adds comprehensive integration with the Delphi interpretability library,
enabling advanced feature analysis for CrossCoder models.

Key features:
- CrossCoder adapters for Delphi compatibility (single and dual model)
- Modified latent cache supporting dual model activation collection
- Anthropic Batch API integration for 10-100x faster processing
- Token alignment and chat template handling for different architectures
- HTML visualizations with feature explanations and scores
- Configuration-driven pipeline with YAML inheritance

Components:
- src/crosscoder/delphi_integration/: Core integration modules
  - crosscoder_adapter.py: Adapters for Delphi's sparse coder interface
  - crosscoder_cache.py: Extended cache for dual model activations
  - batch_explainer.py: Batch API for efficient explanation generation
  - tokenization_bridge.py: Handles chat templates and alignment
- experiments/delphi_analysis/: Analysis pipeline and testing
- configs/delphi_analysis/: YAML configurations
- delphi/: Complete Delphi library included as subfolder

The integration processes millions of tokens efficiently, generates human-readable
explanations for features, and scores their quality using multiple metrics.

Address code review feedback by breaking down large modules into smaller,
focused components for improved maintainability.

## Refactoring Changes

### PRISMA Package (knowledge_storm/prisma/)
- **models.py**: Core data structures (Paper, SearchStrategy, etc.)
- **search.py**: SearchStrategyBuilder for PICO methodology
- **screening.py**: ScreeningAssistant + PRISMAScreener (80/20 rule)
- **extraction.py**: DataExtractionHelper for systematic data extraction
- **reporting.py**: ZeroDraftGenerator for overcoming blank page syndrome
- **assistant.py**: Main PRISMAAssistant orchestrator
- **__init__.py**: Clean exports for external use

### VERIFY Package (knowledge_storm/verify/)
- **models.py**: Core data structures (Claim, VerificationResult, etc.)
- **fact_checker.py**: FactChecker for claim verification
- **memory.py**: ResearchMemory for learning patterns
- **fixer.py**: TargetedFixer for surgical corrections
- **system.py**: Main VERIFYSystem orchestrator
- **__init__.py**: Clean exports for external use

## Task Management Cleanup

- Simplified verbose `details` fields in tasks.json (725 → more readable)
- Moved implementation logs to `.taskmaster/logs/` for better organization
- Preserved essential task definitions while improving JSON readability
- Created backup of original tasks.json

## Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused modules easier to understand/modify
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Reusability**: Individual components can be imported as needed
- **Organization**: Clear separation of concerns across subdirectories
- **Documentation**: Each module has a specific, clear purpose

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing imports continue to work through __init__.py exports
- Updated test_verify_system.py to use new modular imports
- Original large files backed up as .bak files
- No breaking changes to external APIs

marshalling.

The issue with .netrc files is that they are applied system-wide and are
scoped by hostname, meaning we can't differentiate tool repositories
requests from regular requests to CrewAI's API.

* Added is_auto_end flag in agentops.end session in crew.py (#1320)

When using agentops, we have the option to pass the `skip_auto_end_session` parameter, which is supposed to not end the session if the `end_session` function is called by Crew.

Now the way it works is, the `agentops.end_session` accepts `is_auto_end` flag and crewai should have passed it as `True` (its `False` by default). 

I have changed the code to pass is_auto_end=True
